## 0.5.0 (2021-07-12)

Enhancements:

- Populate fingerprint properties automatically
  [#126](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-google-native/issues/126)

- Auto-naming. Resource names (as seen in Google Cloud) are now automatically
  generated unless they are specified in user's program. A dash plus a random
  suffix of length 7 are appended to the logical name of Pulumi resources.
  Auto-naming is not yet available in some resource types; those resources
  have a note "Auto-naming is currently not supported for this resource"
  in their description.
  [#93](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-google-native/issues/93)

- Fix the representation of properties marked as `[Output only]`
  [#134](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-google-native/issues/134),

  [#145](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-google-native/pull/145)

- `storage/*.getObject` functions renamed to `storage/*.getBucketObject` to be
  consistent with the resource name

- Respect all metadata when creating `storage/*.BucketObject`
  [#74](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-google-native/issues/74)
