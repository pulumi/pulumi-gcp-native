 * Verifiers (e.g. Kritis implementations) MUST verify signatures with respect to the trust anchors defined in policy (e.g. a Kritis policy).

In particular, verification implementations MUST NOT treat the signature `public_key_id` as anything more than a key lookup hint. The `public_key_id` DOES NOT validate or authenticate a public key; it only provides a mechanism for quickly selecting a public key ALREADY CONFIGURED on the verifier through a trusted channel. Verification implementations MUST reject signatures in any of the following circumstances: * The `public_key_id` is not recognized by the verifier. * The public key that `public_key_id` refers to does not verify the signature with respect to the payload. The `signature` contents SHOULD NOT be "attached" (where the payload is included with the serialized `signature` bytes). Verifiers MUST ignore any "attached" payload and only verify signatures with respect to explicitly provided payload (e.g. a `payload` field on the proto message that holds this Signature, or the canonical serialization of the proto message that holds this signature).
