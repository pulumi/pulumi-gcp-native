Similar to `validate` stage, the `enforce` stage should return an exit code of `100` to indicate that the resource in now in its desired state. Any other exit code is considered an error. NOTE: An exit code of `100` was chosen over `0` (and `101` vs `1`) to have an explicit indicator of `in desired state`, `not in desired state` and errors.
