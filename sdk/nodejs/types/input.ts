To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [ "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

         * An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [ "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

         * An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [ "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [ "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

Using AppEngineHttpRequest requires [`appengine.applications.get`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/admin-api/access-control) Google IAM permission for the project and the following scope: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform` The task will be delivered to the App Engine app which belongs to the same project as the queue. For more information, see [How Requests are Routed](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/how-requests-are-routed) and how routing is affected by [dispatch files](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/dispatchref). Traffic is encrypted during transport and never leaves Google datacenters. Because this traffic is carried over a communication mechanism internal to Google, you cannot explicitly set the protocol (for example, HTTP or HTTPS). The request to the handler, however, will appear to have used the HTTP protocol. The AppEngineRouting used to construct the URL that the task is delivered to can be set at the queue-level or task-level: * If app_engine_routing_override is set on the queue, this value is used for all tasks in the queue, no matter what the setting is for the task-level app_engine_routing. The `url` that the task will be sent to is: * `url =` host `+` relative_uri Tasks can be dispatched to secure app handlers, unsecure app handlers, and URIs restricted with [`login: admin`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/appref). Because tasks are not run as any user, they cannot be dispatched to URIs restricted with [`login: required`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/appref) Task dispatches also do not follow redirects. The task attempt has succeeded if the app's request handler returns an HTTP response code in the range [`200` - `299`]. The task attempt has failed if the app's handler returns a non-2xx response code or Cloud Tasks does not receive response before the deadline. Failed tasks will be retried according to the retry configuration. `503` (Service Unavailable) is considered an App Engine system error instead of an application error and will cause Cloud Tasks' traffic congestion control to temporarily throttle the queue's dispatches. Unlike other types of task targets, a `429` (Too Many Requests) response from an app handler does not cause traffic congestion control to throttle the queue.

To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [ "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

Traffic is encrypted during transport and never leaves Google datacenters. Because this traffic is carried over a communication mechanism internal to Google, you cannot explicitly set the protocol (for example, HTTP or HTTPS). The request to the handler, however, will appear to have used the HTTP protocol. The AppEngineRouting used to construct the URL that the task is delivered to can be set at the queue-level or task-level: * If set, app_engine_routing_override is used for all tasks in the queue, no matter what the setting is for the task-level app_engine_routing.

Because tasks are not run as any user, they cannot be dispatched to URIs restricted with [`login: required`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/appref) Task dispatches also do not follow redirects. The task attempt has succeeded if the app's request handler returns an HTTP response code in the range [`200` - `299`].

Traffic is encrypted during transport and never leaves Google datacenters. Because this traffic is carried over a communication mechanism internal to Google, you cannot explicitly set the protocol (for example, HTTP or HTTPS). The request to the handler, however, will appear to have used the HTTP protocol. The AppEngineRouting used to construct the URL that the task is delivered to can be set at the queue-level or task-level: * If set, app_engine_routing_override is used for all tasks in the queue, no matter what the setting is for the task-level app_engine_routing. The `url` that the task will be sent to is: * `url =` host `+` relative_uri Tasks can be dispatched to secure app handlers, unsecure app handlers, and URIs restricted with [`login: admin`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/appref). Because tasks are not run as any user, they cannot be dispatched to URIs restricted with [`login: required`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/appref) Task dispatches also do not follow redirects. The task attempt has succeeded if the app's request handler returns an HTTP response code in the range [`200` - `299`]. The task attempt has failed if the app's handler returns a non-2xx response code or Cloud Tasks does not receive response before the deadline. Failed tasks will be retried according to the retry configuration. `503` (Service Unavailable) is considered an App Engine system error instead of an application error and will cause Cloud Tasks' traffic congestion control to temporarily throttle the queue's dispatches. Unlike other types of task targets, a `429` (Too Many Requests) response from an app handler does not cause traffic congestion control to throttle the queue.

         * An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [ "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

         *
         *
         * A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.
         *
         * For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

         * **JSON example:**
         *
         * { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [ "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 }

A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [ "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

         * An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [ "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

         * An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [ "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [ "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

A binding binds one or more members to a single role. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A role is a named list of permissions; each role can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.For some types of Google Cloud resources, a binding can also specify a condition, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to true. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the IAM documentation (https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).JSON example: { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [ "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } YAML example: bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the IAM documentation (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.

To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [ "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.

Acceptable paths are: Google Cloud storage pathLocal path file file glob directory For outputs, the direction of the copy is reversed: ``` gsutil cp /mnt/disk/file.txt gs://my-bucket/bar.txt ``` Acceptable paths are: Local pathGoogle Cloud Storage path file file file directory - directory must already exist glob directory - directory will be created if it doesn't exist One restriction due to docker limitations, is that for outputs that are found on the boot disk, the local path cannot be a glob and must be a file.

A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.

The only valid relational operation for text fields is equality (`=`), where text is searched within the field, rather than having the field be equal to the text. For example, `"Comment = great"` returns messages with `great` in the comment field. * A number field value can be written as an integer, a decimal, or an exponential. The valid relational operators for number fields are the equality operator (`=`), along with the less than/greater than operators (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`). Note that there is no inequality (`!=`) operator. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. * A date field value must be written in `yyyy-mm-dd` form. Fields with date and time use the RFC3339 time format. Leading zeros are required for one-digit months and days. The valid relational operators for date fields are the equality operator (`=`) , along with the less than/greater than operators (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`). Note that there is no inequality (`!=`) operator. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. * Multiple field query expressions can be combined in one query by adding `AND` or `OR` operators between the expressions. If a boolean operator appears within a quoted string, it is not treated as special, it's just another part of the character string to be matched. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. The following fields and functions are available for filtering: * `message_type`, from the MSH-9.1 field. For example, `NOT message_type = "ADT"`. * `send_date` or `sendDate`, the YYYY-MM-DD date the message was sent in the dataset's time_zone, from the MSH-7 segment. For example, `send_date < "2017-01-02"`. * `send_time`, the timestamp when the message was sent, using the RFC3339 time format for comparisons, from the MSH-7 segment. For example, `send_time < "2017-01-02T00:00:00-05:00"`. * `create_time`, the timestamp when the message was created in the HL7v2 store. Use the RFC3339 time format for comparisons. For example, `create_time < "2017-01-02T00:00:00-05:00"`. * `send_facility`, the care center that the message came from, from the MSH-4 segment. For example, `send_facility = "ABC"`. * `PatientId(value, type)`, which matches if the message lists a patient having an ID of the given value and type in the PID-2, PID-3, or PID-4 segments. For example, `PatientId("123456", "MRN")`. * `labels.x`, a string value of the label with key `x` as set using the Message.labels map. For example, `labels."priority"="high"`. The operator `:*` can be used to assert the existence of a label. For example, `labels."priority":*`.

The server reuses the existing tables (if any) that are named after the resource types. For example, "Patient", "Observation". When there is no existing table for a given resource type, the server attempts to create one. When a table schema doesn't align with the schema config, either because of existing incompatible schema or out of band incompatible modification, the server does not stream in new data. BigQuery imposes a 1 MB limit on streaming insert row size, therefore any resource mutation that generates more than 1 MB of BigQuery data is not streamed. One resolution in this case is to delete the incompatible table and let the server recreate one, though the newly created table only contains data after the table recreation. Results are appended to the corresponding BigQuery tables. Different versions of the same resource are distinguishable by the meta.versionId and meta.lastUpdated columns. The operation (CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE) that results in the new version is recorded in the meta.tag. The tables contain all historical resource versions since streaming was enabled. For query convenience, the server also creates one view per table of the same name containing only the current resource version. The streamed data in the BigQuery dataset is not guaranteed to be completely unique. The combination of the id and meta.versionId columns should ideally identify a single unique row. But in rare cases, duplicates may exist. At query time, users may use the SQL select statement to keep only one of the duplicate rows given an id and meta.versionId pair. Alternatively, the server created view mentioned above also filters out duplicates. If a resource mutation cannot be streamed to BigQuery, errors are logged to Cloud Logging.

You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. * Multiple field query expressions can be combined in one query by adding `AND` or `OR` operators between the expressions. If a boolean operator appears within a quoted string, it is not treated as special, it's just another part of the character string to be matched. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. Fields/functions available for filtering are: * `message_type`, from the MSH-9.1 field. For example, `NOT message_type = "ADT"`. * `send_date` or `sendDate`, the YYYY-MM-DD date the message was sent in the dataset's time_zone, from the MSH-7 segment. For example, `send_date < "2017-01-02"`. * `send_time`, the timestamp when the message was sent, using the RFC3339 time format for comparisons, from the MSH-7 segment. For example, `send_time < "2017-01-02T00:00:00-05:00"`. * `create_time`, the timestamp when the message was created in the HL7v2 store. Use the RFC3339 time format for comparisons. For example, `create_time < "2017-01-02T00:00:00-05:00"`. * `send_facility`, the care center that the message came from, from the MSH-4 segment. For example, `send_facility = "ABC"`. * `PatientId(value, type)`, which matches if the message lists a patient having an ID of the given value and type in the PID-2, PID-3, or PID-4 segments. For example, `PatientId("123456", "MRN")`. * `labels.x`, a string value of the label with key `x` as set using the Message.labels map. For example, `labels."priority"="high"`. The operator `:*` can be used to assert the existence of a label. For example, `labels."priority":*`.

When there is no existing table for a given resource type, the server attempts to create one. When a table schema doesn't align with the schema config, either because of existing incompatible schema or out of band incompatible modification, the server does not stream in new data. One resolution in this case is to delete the incompatible table and let the server recreate one, though the newly created table only contains data after the table recreation. BigQuery imposes a 1 MB limit on streaming insert row size, therefore any resource mutation that generates more than 1 MB of BigQuery data will not be streamed. Results are appended to the corresponding BigQuery tables. Different versions of the same resource are distinguishable by the meta.versionId and meta.lastUpdated columns. The operation (CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE) that results in the new version is recorded in the meta.tag. The tables contain all historical resource versions since streaming was enabled. For query convenience, the server also creates one view per table of the same name containing only the current resource version. The streamed data in the BigQuery dataset is not guaranteed to be completely unique. The combination of the id and meta.versionId columns should ideally identify a single unique row. But in rare cases, duplicates may exist. At query time, users may use the SQL select statement to keep only one of the duplicate rows given an id and meta.versionId pair. Alternatively, the server created view mentioned above also filters out duplicates. If a resource mutation cannot be streamed to BigQuery, errors will be logged to Cloud Logging (see [Viewing error logs in Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/logging)).

However, if the unit is kBy, then the value of the metric is always in thousands of bytes, no matter how it might be displayed.If you want a custom metric to record the exact number of CPU-seconds used by a job, you can create an INT64 CUMULATIVE metric whose unit is s{CPU} (or equivalently 1s{CPU} or just s). If the job uses 12,005 CPU-seconds, then the value is written as 12005.Alternatively, if you want a custom metric to record data in a more granular way, you can create a DOUBLE CUMULATIVE metric whose unit is ks{CPU}, and then write the value 12.005 (which is 12005/1000), or use Kis{CPU} and write 11.723 (which is 12005/1024).The supported units are a subset of The Unified Code for Units of Measure (https://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum.html) standard:Basic units (UNIT) bit bit By byte s second min minute h hour d day 1 dimensionlessPrefixes (PREFIX) k kilo (10^3) M mega (10^6) G giga (10^9) T tera (10^12) P peta (10^15) E exa (10^18) Z zetta (10^21) Y yotta (10^24) m milli (10^-3) u micro (10^-6) n nano (10^-9) p pico (10^-12) f femto (10^-15) a atto (10^-18) z zepto (10^-21) y yocto (10^-24) Ki kibi (2^10) Mi mebi (2^20) Gi gibi (2^30) Ti tebi (2^40) Pi pebi (2^50)GrammarThe grammar also includes these connectors: / division or ratio (as an infix operator). For examples, kBy/{email} or MiBy/10ms (although you should almost never have /s in a metric unit; rates should always be computed at query time from the underlying cumulative or delta value). . multiplication or composition (as an infix operator). For examples, GBy.d or k{watt}.h.The grammar for a unit is as follows: Expression = Component { "." Component } { "/" Component } ; Component = ( [ PREFIX ] UNIT | "%" ) [ Annotation ] | Annotation | "1" ; Annotation = "{" NAME "}" ; Notes: Annotation is just a comment if it follows a UNIT. If the annotation is used alone, then the unit is equivalent to 1. For examples, {request}/s == 1/s, By{transmitted}/s == By/s. NAME is a sequence of non-blank printable ASCII characters not containing { or }. 1 represents a unitary dimensionless unit (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_quantity) of 1, such as in 1/s. It is typically used when none of the basic units are appropriate. For example, "new users per day" can be represented as 1/d or {new-users}/d (and a metric value 5 would mean "5 new users). Alternatively, "thousands of page views per day" would be represented as 1000/d or k1/d or k{page_views}/d (and a metric value of 5.3 would mean "5300 page views per day"). % represents dimensionless value of 1/100, and annotates values giving a percentage (so the metric values are typically in the range of 0..100, and a metric value 3 means "3 percent"). 10^2.% indicates a metric contains a ratio, typically in the range 0..1, that will be multiplied by 100 and displayed as a percentage (so a metric value 0.03 means "3 percent").

A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [ "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

Reduction involves applying a cross_series_reducer to all the time series, optionally sorting the time series into subsets with group_by_fields, and applying the reducer to each subset.The raw time series data can contain a huge amount of information from multiple sources. Alignment and reduction transforms this mass of data into a more manageable and representative collection of data, for example "the 95% latency across the average of all tasks in a cluster".

         * An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [ "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

         * An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [ "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

         * An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [ "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.

A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [ "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [ "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

        /**
         * # gRPC Transcoding gRPC Transcoding is a feature for mapping between a gRPC method and one or more HTTP REST endpoints. It allows developers to build a single API service that supports both gRPC APIs and REST APIs. Many systems, including [Google APIs](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis), [Cloud Endpoints](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints), [gRPC Gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway), and [Envoy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy) proxy support this feature and use it for large scale production services. `HttpRule` defines the schema of the gRPC/REST mapping. The mapping specifies how different portions of the gRPC request message are mapped to the URL path, URL query parameters, and HTTP request body. It also controls how the gRPC response message is mapped to the HTTP response body. `HttpRule` is typically specified as an `google.api.http` annotation on the gRPC method. Each mapping specifies a URL path template and an HTTP method. The path template may refer to one or more fields in the gRPC request message, as long as each field is a non-repeated field with a primitive (non-message) type. The path template controls how fields of the request message are mapped to the URL path. Example: service Messaging { rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) { option (google.api.http) = { get: "/v1/{name=messages/*}" }; } } message GetMessageRequest { string name = 1; // Mapped to URL path. } message Message { string text = 1; // The resource content. } This enables an HTTP REST to gRPC mapping as below: HTTP | gRPC -----|----- `GET /v1/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(name: "messages/123456")` Any fields in the request message which are not bound by the path template automatically become HTTP query parameters if there is no HTTP request body. For example: service Messaging { rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) { option (google.api.http) = { get:"/v1/messages/{message_id}" }; } } message GetMessageRequest { message SubMessage { string subfield = 1; } string message_id = 1; // Mapped to URL path. int64 revision = 2; // Mapped to URL query parameter `revision`. SubMessage sub = 3; // Mapped to URL query parameter `sub.subfield`. } This enables a HTTP JSON to RPC mapping as below: HTTP | gRPC -----|----- `GET /v1/messages/123456?revision=2&sub.subfield=foo` | `GetMessage(message_id: "123456" revision: 2 sub: SubMessage(subfield: "foo"))` Note that fields which are mapped to URL query parameters must have a primitive type or a repeated primitive type or a non-repeated message type. In the case of a repeated type, the parameter can be repeated in the URL as `...?param=A&param=B`. In the case of a message type, each field of the message is mapped to a separate parameter, such as `...?foo.a=A&foo.b=B&foo.c=C`. For HTTP methods that allow a request body, the `body` field specifies the mapping. Consider a REST update method on the message resource collection: service Messaging { rpc UpdateMessage(UpdateMessageRequest) returns (Message) { option (google.api.http) = { patch: "/v1/messages/{message_id}" body: "message" }; } } message UpdateMessageRequest { string message_id = 1; // mapped to the URL Message message = 2; // mapped to the body } The following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is enabled, where the representation of the JSON in the request body is determined by protos JSON encoding: HTTP | gRPC -----|----- `PATCH /v1/messages/123456 { "text": "Hi!" }` | `UpdateMessage(message_id: "123456" message { text: "Hi!" })` The special name `*` can be used in the body mapping to define that every field not bound by the path template should be mapped to the request body. This enables the following alternative definition of the update method: service Messaging { rpc UpdateMessage(Message) returns (Message) { option (google.api.http) = { patch: "/v1/messages/{message_id}" body: "*" }; } } message Message { string message_id = 1; string text = 2; } The following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is enabled: HTTP | gRPC -----|----- `PATCH /v1/messages/123456 { "text": "Hi!" }` | `UpdateMessage(message_id: "123456" text: "Hi!")` Note that when using `*` in the body mapping, it is not possible to have HTTP parameters, as all fields not bound by the path end in the body. This makes this option more rarely used in practice when defining REST APIs. The common usage of `*` is in custom methods which don't use the URL at all for transferring data. It is possible to define multiple HTTP methods for one RPC by using the `additional_bindings` option. Example: service Messaging { rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) { option (google.api.http) = { get: "/v1/messages/{message_id}" additional_bindings { get: "/v1/users/{user_id}/messages/{message_id}" } }; } } message GetMessageRequest { string message_id = 1; string user_id = 2; } This enables the following two alternative HTTP JSON to RPC mappings: HTTP | gRPC -----|----- `GET /v1/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(message_id: "123456")` `GET /v1/users/me/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(user_id: "me" message_id: "123456")` ## Rules for HTTP mapping 1. Leaf request fields (recursive expansion nested messages in the request message) are classified into three categories: - Fields referred by the path template. They are passed via the URL path. - Fields referred by the HttpRule.body. They are passed via the HTTP request body. - All other fields are passed via the URL query parameters, and the parameter name is the field path in the request message. A repeated field can be represented as multiple query parameters under the same name. 2. If HttpRule.body is "*", there is no URL query parameter, all fields are passed via URL path and HTTP request body. 3. If HttpRule.body is omitted, there is no HTTP request body, all fields are passed via URL path and URL query parameters. ### Path template syntax Template = "/" Segments [ Verb ] ; Segments = Segment { "/" Segment } ; Segment = "*" | "**" | LITERAL | Variable ; Variable = "{" FieldPath [ "=" Segments ] "}" ; FieldPath = IDENT { "." IDENT } ; Verb = ":" LITERAL ; The syntax `*` matches a single URL path segment. The syntax `**` matches zero or more URL path segments, which must be the last part of the URL path except the `Verb`. The syntax `Variable` matches part of the URL path as specified by its template. A variable template must not contain other variables. If a variable matches a single path segment, its template may be omitted, e.g. `{var}` is equivalent to `{var=*}`. The syntax `LITERAL` matches literal text in the URL path. If the `LITERAL` contains any reserved character, such characters should be percent-encoded before the matching. If a variable contains exactly one path segment, such as `"{var}"` or `"{var=*}"`, when such a variable is expanded into a URL path on the client side, all characters except `[-_.~0-9a-zA-Z]` are percent-encoded. The server side does the reverse decoding. Such variables show up in the [Discovery Document](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/reference/apis) as `{var}`. If a variable contains multiple path segments, such as `"{var=foo/*}"` or `"{var=**}"`, when such a variable is expanded into a URL path on the client side, all characters except `[-_.~/0-9a-zA-Z]` are percent-encoded. The server side does the reverse decoding, except "%2F" and "%2f" are left unchanged. Such variables show up in the [Discovery Document](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/reference/apis) as `{+var}`. ## Using gRPC API Service Configuration gRPC API Service Configuration (service config) is a configuration language for configuring a gRPC service to become a user-facing product. The service config is simply the YAML representation of the `google.api.Service` proto message. As an alternative to annotating your proto file, you can configure gRPC transcoding in your service config YAML files. You do this by specifying a `HttpRule` that maps the gRPC method to a REST endpoint, achieving the same effect as the proto annotation. This can be particularly useful if you have a proto that is reused in multiple services. Note that any transcoding specified in the service config will override any matching transcoding configuration in the proto. Example: http: rules: # Selects a gRPC method and applies HttpRule to it. - selector: example.v1.Messaging.GetMessage get: /v1/messages/{message_id}/{sub.subfield} ## Special notes When gRPC Transcoding is used to map a gRPC to JSON REST endpoints, the proto to JSON conversion must follow the [proto3 specification](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json). While the single segment variable follows the semantics of [RFC 6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570) Section 3.2.2 Simple String Expansion, the multi segment variable **does not** follow RFC 6570 Section 3.2.3 Reserved Expansion. The reason is that the Reserved Expansion does not expand special characters like `?` and `#`, which would lead to invalid URLs. As the result, gRPC Transcoding uses a custom encoding for multi segment variables. The path variables **must not** refer to any repeated or mapped field, because client libraries are not capable of handling such variable expansion. The path variables **must not** capture the leading "/" character. The reason is that the most common use case "{var}" does not capture the leading "/" character. For consistency, all path variables must share the same behavior. Repeated message fields must not be mapped to URL query parameters, because no client library can support such complicated mapping. If an API needs to use a JSON array for request or response body, it can map the request or response body to a repeated field. However, some gRPC Transcoding implementations may not support this feature.

Different systems might scale the values to be more easily displayed (so a value of `0.02kBy` _might_ be displayed as `20By`, and a value of `3523kBy` _might_ be displayed as `3.5MBy`). However, if the `unit` is `kBy`, then the value of the metric is always in thousands of bytes, no matter how it might be displayed. If you want a custom metric to record the exact number of CPU-seconds used by a job, you can create an `INT64 CUMULATIVE` metric whose `unit` is `s{CPU}` (or equivalently `1s{CPU}` or just `s`). If the job uses 12,005 CPU-seconds, then the value is written as `12005`. Alternatively, if you want a custom metric to record data in a more granular way, you can create a `DOUBLE CUMULATIVE` metric whose `unit` is `ks{CPU}`, and then write the value `12.005` (which is `12005/1000`), or use `Kis{CPU}` and write `11.723` (which is `12005/1024`). The supported units are a subset of [The Unified Code for Units of Measure](https://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum.html) standard: **Basic units (UNIT)** * `bit` bit * `By` byte * `s` second * `min` minute * `h` hour * `d` day * `1` dimensionless **Prefixes (PREFIX)** * `k` kilo (10^3) * `M` mega (10^6) * `G` giga (10^9) * `T` tera (10^12) * `P` peta (10^15) * `E` exa (10^18) * `Z` zetta (10^21) * `Y` yotta (10^24) * `m` milli (10^-3) * `u` micro (10^-6) * `n` nano (10^-9) * `p` pico (10^-12) * `f` femto (10^-15) * `a` atto (10^-18) * `z` zepto (10^-21) * `y` yocto (10^-24) * `Ki` kibi (2^10) * `Mi` mebi (2^20) * `Gi` gibi (2^30) * `Ti` tebi (2^40) * `Pi` pebi (2^50) **Grammar** The grammar also includes these connectors: * `/` division or ratio (as an infix operator). For examples, `kBy/{email}` or `MiBy/10ms` (although you should almost never have `/s` in a metric `unit`; rates should always be computed at query time from the underlying cumulative or delta value). * `.` multiplication or composition (as an infix operator). For examples, `GBy.d` or `k{watt}.h`. The grammar for a unit is as follows: Expression = Component { "." Component } { "/" Component } ; Component = ( [ PREFIX ] UNIT | "%" ) [ Annotation ] | Annotation | "1" ; Annotation = "{" NAME "}" ; Notes: * `Annotation` is just a comment if it follows a `UNIT`. If the annotation is used alone, then the unit is equivalent to `1`. For examples, `{request}/s == 1/s`, `By{transmitted}/s == By/s`. * `NAME` is a sequence of non-blank printable ASCII characters not containing `{` or `}`. * `1` represents a unitary [dimensionless unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_quantity) of 1, such as in `1/s`. It is typically used when none of the basic units are appropriate. For example, "new users per day" can be represented as `1/d` or `{new-users}/d` (and a metric value `5` would mean "5 new users). Alternatively, "thousands of page views per day" would be represented as `1000/d` or `k1/d` or `k{page_views}/d` (and a metric value of `5.3` would mean "5300 page views per day"). * `%` represents dimensionless value of 1/100, and annotates values giving a percentage (so the metric values are typically in the range of 0..100, and a metric value `3` means "3 percent"). * `10^2.%` indicates a metric contains a ratio, typically in the range 0..1, that will be multiplied by 100 and displayed as a percentage (so a metric value `0.03` means "3 percent").

For example, rather than providing a phrase hint for every month of the year (e.g. "i was born in january", "i was born in febuary", ...), use the pre-built `$MONTH` class improves the likelihood of correctly transcribing audio that includes months (e.g. "i was born in $month"). To refer to pre-built classes, use the class' symbol prepended with `$` e.g. `$MONTH`. To refer to custom classes that were defined inline in the request, set the class's `custom_class_id` to a string unique to all class resources and inline classes. Then use the class' id wrapped in $`{...}` e.g. "${my-months}". To refer to custom classes resources, use the class' id wrapped in `${}` (e.g. `${my-months}`).

Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type. Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++. Foo foo = ...; Any any; any.PackFrom(foo); ... if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) { ... } Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java. Foo foo = ...; Any any = Any.pack(foo); ... if (any.is(Foo.class)) { foo = any.unpack(Foo.class); } Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python. foo = Foo(...) any = Any() any.Pack(foo) ... if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR): any.Unpack(foo) ... Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go foo := &pb.Foo{...} any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo) ... foo := &pb.Foo{} if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil { ... } The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use 'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/' in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type name "y.z". # JSON The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example: package google.profile; message Person { string first_name = 1; string last_name = 2; } { "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person", "firstName": , "lastName": } If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type` field. Example (for message google.protobuf.Duration): { "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration", "value": "1.212s" }

The last segment of the URL's path must represent the fully qualified name of the type (as in `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading "." is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows: * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed. * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a google.protobuf.Type value in binary format, or produce an error. * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with type.googleapis.com. Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be used with implementation specific semantics.
