App Check metrics continue to be collected to help you detect issues with your App Check integration and monitor the composition of your callers. While the service is protected by App Check, other applicable protections, such as user authorization, continue to be enforced at the same time. Use caution when choosing to enforce App Check on a Firebase service. If your users have not updated to an App Check capable version of your app, their apps will no longer be able to use your Firebase services that are enforcing App Check. App Check metrics can help you decide whether to enforce App Check on your Firebase services. If your app has not launched yet, you should enable enforcement immediately, since there are no outdated clients in use. Some services require certain conditions to be met before they will work with App Check, such as requiring you to upgrade to a specific service tier.
