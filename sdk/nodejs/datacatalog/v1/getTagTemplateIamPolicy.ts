 * Gets the access control policy for a resource. May return: * A`NOT_FOUND` error if the resource doesn't exist or you don't have the permission to view it. * An empty policy if the resource exists but doesn't have a set policy. Supported resources are: - Tag templates - Entry groups Note: This method doesn't get policies from Google Cloud Platform resources ingested into Data Catalog. To call this method, you must have the following Google IAM permissions: - `datacatalog.tagTemplates.getIamPolicy` to get policies on tag templates. - `datacatalog.entryGroups.getIamPolicy` to get policies on entry groups.
