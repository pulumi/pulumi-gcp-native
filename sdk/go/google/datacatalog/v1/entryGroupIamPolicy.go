// Sets an access control policy for a resource. Replaces any existing policy. Supported resources are: - Tag templates - Entry groups Note: This method sets policies only within Data Catalog and can't be used to manage policies in BigQuery, Pub/Sub, Dataproc Metastore, and any external Google Cloud Platform resources synced with the Data Catalog. To call this method, you must have the following Google IAM permissions: - `datacatalog.tagTemplates.setIamPolicy` to set policies on tag templates. - `datacatalog.entryGroups.setIamPolicy` to set policies on entry groups.
// Note - this resource's API doesn't support deletion. When deleted, the resource will persist
// on Google Cloud even though it will be deleted from Pulumi state.

Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to the `bindings` in the `Policy`.
