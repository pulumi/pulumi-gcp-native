// Creates an instance and begins preparing it to begin serving. The returned long-running operation can be used to track the progress of preparing the new instance. The instance name is assigned by the caller. If the named instance already exists, `CreateInstance` returns `ALREADY_EXISTS`. Immediately upon completion of this request: * The instance is readable via the API, with all requested attributes but no allocated resources. Its state is `CREATING`. Until completion of the returned operation: * Cancelling the operation renders the instance immediately unreadable via the API. * The instance can be deleted. * All other attempts to modify the instance are rejected. Upon completion of the returned operation: * Billing for all successfully-allocated resources begins (some types may have lower than the requested levels). * Databases can be created in the instance. * The instance's allocated resource levels are readable via the API. * The instance's state becomes `READY`. The returned long-running operation will have a name of the format `/operations/` and can be used to track creation of the instance. The metadata field type is CreateInstanceMetadata. The response field type is Instance, if successful.
