	PortRange pulumi.StringPtrInput
	// The ports field is only supported when the forwarding rule references a backend_service directly. Supported load balancing products are Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing and Network Load Balancing. Only packets addressed to the specified list of ports are forwarded to backends.
	//
	// You can only use one of ports and port_range, or allPorts. The three are mutually exclusive.
	//
	// You can specify a list of up to five ports, which can be non-contiguous.
	//
	// For Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing, if you specify allPorts, you should not specify ports.
	//
	// For more information, see [Port specifications](/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#port_specifications).
	Ports   pulumi.StringArrayInput
	Project pulumi.StringInput
	// [Output Only] The PSC connection id of the PSC Forwarding Rule.
	PscConnectionId pulumi.StringPtrInput

	// It is only supported for Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing and Internal HTTP(S) Load Balancing.
	ServiceDirectoryRegistrations ForwardingRuleServiceDirectoryRegistrationArrayInput
	// An optional prefix to the service name for this Forwarding Rule. If specified, the prefix is the first label of the fully qualified service name.
	//
	// The label must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the label must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.

	// This field is only used for internal load balancing.
	ServiceLabel pulumi.StringPtrInput

	ServiceName pulumi.StringPtrInput
	// This field is only used for internal load balancing.
	//
	// For internal load balancing, this field identifies the subnetwork that the load balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding Rule.
