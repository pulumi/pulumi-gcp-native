	// User-provided name of the Organization security plicy. The name should be unique in the organization in which the security policy is created. This should only be used when SecurityPolicyType is FIREWALL. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.

The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and changes after every request to modify or update metadata. You must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or change metadata, otherwise the request will fail with error 412 conditionNotMet. To see the latest fingerprint, make get() request to the security policy.

	Kind string `pulumi:"kind"`
	// A fingerprint for the labels being applied to this security policy, which is essentially a hash of the labels set used for optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and changes after every request to modify or update labels. You must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or change labels. To see the latest fingerprint, make get() request to the security policy.

	// The type indicates the intended use of the security policy. CLOUD_ARMOR - Cloud Armor backend security policies can be configured to filter incoming HTTP requests targeting backend services. They filter requests before they hit the origin servers. CLOUD_ARMOR_EDGE - Cloud Armor edge security policies can be configured to filter incoming HTTP requests targeting backend services (including Cloud CDN-enabled) as well as backend buckets (GCS). They filter requests before the request is served from Googleâ€™s cache.
