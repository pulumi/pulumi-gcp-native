	// `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.
	//
	// **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.

	// If more than one rule is specified, the rules are applied in the following manner: - All matching LOG rules are always applied. - If any DENY/DENY_WITH_LOG rule matches, permission is denied. Logging will be applied if one or more matching rule requires logging. - Otherwise, if any ALLOW/ALLOW_WITH_LOG rule matches, permission is granted. Logging will be applied if one or more matching rule requires logging. - Otherwise, if no rule applies, permission is denied.
	Rules []RuleResponse `pulumi:"rules"`
	// Specifies the format of the policy.
	//
	// Valid values are `0`, `1`, and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected.
	//
	// Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations:
	//
	// * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy that includes conditions
	//
	// **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
	//
	// If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version or leave the field unset.
	//
	// To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).
