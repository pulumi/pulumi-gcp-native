The algorithm has the property that the addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts only affects 1/N of the requests. - RANDOM: The load balancer selects a random healthy host. - ORIGINAL_DESTINATION: Backend host is selected based on the client connection metadata, i.e., connections are opened to the same address as the destination address of the incoming connection before the connection was redirected to the load balancer. - MAGLEV: used as a drop in replacement for the ring hash load balancer. Maglev is not as stable as ring hash but has faster table lookup build times and host selection times. For more information about Maglev, see https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub44824 This field is applicable to either: - A regional backend service with the service_protocol set to HTTP, HTTPS, or HTTP2, and load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_MANAGED. - A global backend service with the load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. If sessionAffinity is not NONE, and this field is not set to MAGLEV or RING_HASH, session affinity settings will not take effect. Only ROUND_ROBIN and RING_HASH are supported when the backend service is referenced by a URL map that is bound to target gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless field set to true.
	LocalityLbPolicy RegionBackendServiceLocalityLbPolicyPtrInput
	// This field denotes the logging options for the load balancer traffic served by this backend service. If logging is enabled, logs will be exported to Stackdriver.
	LogConfig BackendServiceLogConfigPtrInput
	// Specifies the default maximum duration (timeout) for streams to this service. Duration is computed from the beginning of the stream until the response has been completely processed, including all retries. A stream that does not complete in this duration is closed. If not specified, there will be no timeout limit, i.e. the maximum duration is infinite. This value can be overridden in the PathMatcher configuration of the UrlMap that references this backend service. This field is only allowed when the loadBalancingScheme of the backend service is INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
	MaxStreamDuration DurationPtrInput
	// Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
	Name pulumi.StringPtrInput
	// The URL of the network to which this backend service belongs. This field can only be specified when the load balancing scheme is set to INTERNAL.
	Network pulumi.StringPtrInput
	// Settings controlling the eviction of unhealthy hosts from the load balancing pool for the backend service. If not set, this feature is considered disabled. This field is applicable to either: - A regional backend service with the service_protocol set to HTTP, HTTPS, or HTTP2, and load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_MANAGED. - A global backend service with the load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. Not supported when the backend service is referenced by a URL map that is bound to target gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless field set to true.
	OutlierDetection OutlierDetectionPtrInput
	// Deprecated in favor of portName. The TCP port to connect on the backend. The default value is 80. For Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing and Network Load Balancing, omit port.

	// Deprecated: Deprecated in favor of portName. The TCP port to connect on the backend. The default value is 80. For Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing and Network Load Balancing, omit port.
	Port pulumi.IntPtrInput
	// A named port on a backend instance group representing the port for communication to the backend VMs in that group. The named port must be [defined on each backend instance group](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/backend-service#named_ports). This parameter has no meaning if the backends are NEGs. For Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing and Network Load Balancing, omit port_name.
	PortName pulumi.StringPtrInput
	Project  pulumi.StringPtrInput
	// The protocol this BackendService uses to communicate with backends. Possible values are HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP2, TCP, SSL, UDP or GRPC. depending on the chosen load balancer or Traffic Director configuration. Refer to the documentation for the load balancers or for Traffic Director for more information. Must be set to GRPC when the backend service is referenced by a URL map that is bound to target gRPC proxy.
	Protocol RegionBackendServiceProtocolPtrInput
	Region   pulumi.StringInput
	// An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
	RequestId pulumi.StringPtrInput
	// This field specifies the security settings that apply to this backend service. This field is applicable to a global backend service with the load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
	SecuritySettings SecuritySettingsPtrInput
	// URLs of networkservices.ServiceBinding resources. Can only be set if load balancing scheme is INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. If set, lists of backends and health checks must be both empty.
	ServiceBindings pulumi.StringArrayInput
	// Type of session affinity to use. The default is NONE. Only NONE and HEADER_FIELD are supported when the backend service is referenced by a URL map that is bound to target gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless field set to true. For more details, see: [Session Affinity](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/backend-service#session_affinity).

	// The backend service timeout has a different meaning depending on the type of load balancer. For more information see, Backend service settings. The default is 30 seconds. The full range of timeout values allowed goes from 1 through 2,147,483,647 seconds. This value can be overridden in the PathMatcher configuration of the UrlMap that references this backend service. Not supported when the backend service is referenced by a URL map that is bound to target gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless field set to true. Instead, use maxStreamDuration.
