	// Type of interconnect, which can take one of the following values:
	// - PARTNER: A partner-managed interconnection shared between customers though a partner.

	InterconnectType string `pulumi:"interconnectType"`
	// Type of the resource. Always compute#interconnect for interconnects.
	Kind string `pulumi:"kind"`
	// A fingerprint for the labels being applied to this Interconnect, which is essentially a hash of the labels set used for optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and changes after every request to modify or update labels. You must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or change labels, otherwise the request will fail with error 412 conditionNotMet.

	// To see the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to retrieve an Interconnect.

	// URL of the InterconnectLocation object that represents where this connection is to be provisioned.
	Location string `pulumi:"location"`
	// Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.

	// - OS_ACTIVE: A valid Interconnect, which is turned up and is ready to use. Attachments may be provisioned on this Interconnect.
	// - OS_UNPROVISIONED: An Interconnect that has not completed turnup. No attachments may be provisioned on this Interconnect.
	// - OS_UNDER_MAINTENANCE: An Interconnect that is undergoing internal maintenance. No attachments may be provisioned or updated on this Interconnect.
	OperationalStatus string `pulumi:"operationalStatus"`
	// IP address configured on the customer side of the Interconnect link. The customer should configure this IP address during turnup when prompted by Google NOC. This can be used only for ping tests.

	SelfLinkWithId string `pulumi:"selfLinkWithId"`
	// The current state of Interconnect functionality, which can take one of the following values:
	// - ACTIVE: The Interconnect is valid, turned up and ready to use. Attachments may be provisioned on this Interconnect.
	// - UNPROVISIONED: The Interconnect has not completed turnup. No attachments may be provisioned on this Interconnect.
	// - UNDER_MAINTENANCE: The Interconnect is undergoing internal maintenance. No attachments may be provisioned or updated on this Interconnect.
