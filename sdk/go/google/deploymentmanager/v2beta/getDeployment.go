	// An optional user-provided description of the deployment.
	Description string `pulumi:"description"`
	// Provides a fingerprint to use in requests to modify a deployment, such as `update()`, `stop()`, and `cancelPreview()` requests. A fingerprint is a randomly generated value that must be provided with `update()`, `stop()`, and `cancelPreview()` requests to perform optimistic locking. This ensures optimistic concurrency so that only one request happens at a time. The fingerprint is initially generated by Deployment Manager and changes after every request to modify data. To get the latest fingerprint value, perform a `get()` request to a deployment.
	Fingerprint string `pulumi:"fingerprint"`
	// Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.
	InsertTime string `pulumi:"insertTime"`
	// Map of One Platform labels; provided by the client when the resource is created or updated. Specifically: Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long and must conform to the following regular expression: `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` Label values must be between 0 and 63 characters long and must conform to the regular expression `([a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)?`.
	Labels []DeploymentLabelEntryResponse `pulumi:"labels"`
	// URL of the manifest representing the last manifest that was successfully deployed. If no manifest has been successfully deployed, this field will be absent.
	Manifest string `pulumi:"manifest"`
	// Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
	Name string `pulumi:"name"`
	// The Operation that most recently ran, or is currently running, on this deployment.
	Operation OperationResponse `pulumi:"operation"`
	// Server defined URL for the resource.
	SelfLink string `pulumi:"selfLink"`
	// [Input Only] The parameters that define your deployment, including the deployment configuration and relevant templates.
	Target TargetConfigurationResponse `pulumi:"target"`
	// If Deployment Manager is currently updating or previewing an update to this deployment, the updated configuration appears here.
	Update DeploymentUpdateResponse `pulumi:"update"`
	// Update timestamp in RFC3339 text format.
	UpdateTime string `pulumi:"updateTime"`
