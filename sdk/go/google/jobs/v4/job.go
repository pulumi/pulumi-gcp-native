	// Strongly recommended for the best service experience. Location(s) where the employer is looking to hire for this job posting. Specifying the full street address(es) of the hiring location enables better API results, especially job searches by commute time. At most 50 locations are allowed for best search performance. If a job has more locations, it is suggested to split it into multiple jobs with unique requisition_ids (e.g. 'ReqA' becomes 'ReqA-1', 'ReqA-2', and so on.) as multiple jobs with the same company, language_code and requisition_id are not allowed. If the original requisition_id must be preserved, a custom field should be used for storage. It is also suggested to group the locations that close to each other in the same job for better search experience. Jobs with multiple addresses must have their addresses with the same LocationType to allow location filtering to work properly. (For example, a Job with addresses "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA, USA" and "London, UK" may not have location filters applied correctly at search time since the first is a LocationType.STREET_ADDRESS and the second is a LocationType.LOCALITY.) If a job needs to have multiple addresses, it is suggested to split it into multiple jobs with same LocationTypes. The maximum number of allowed characters is 500.

At most 100 filterable and at most 100 unfilterable keys are supported. For filterable `string_values`, across all keys at most 200 values are allowed, with each string no more than 255 characters.

The expired job can't be listed by the ListJobs API, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or updated with the UpdateJob API or deleted with the DeleteJob API. An expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration timestamp. Updating an expired job fails if there is another existing open job with same company, language_code and requisition_id. The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum number of open jobs over previous 7 days. If this threshold is exceeded, expired jobs are cleaned out in order of earliest expire time. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. Invalid timestamps are ignored, and treated as expire time not provided. If the timestamp is before the instant request is made, the job is treated as expired immediately on creation. This kind of job can not be updated. And when creating a job with past timestamp, the posting_publish_time must be set before posting_expire_time. The purpose of this feature is to allow other objects, such as Application, to refer a job that didn't exist in the system prior to becoming expired. If you want to modify a job that was expired on creation, delete it and create a new one. If this value isn't provided at the time of job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job's creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value isn't provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_mask. If the field masks include job_end_time, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job's last update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn't updated.

Specifying the full street address(es) of the hiring location enables better API results, especially job searches by commute time. At most 50 locations are allowed for best search performance. If a job has more locations, it is suggested to split it into multiple jobs with unique requisition_ids (e.g. 'ReqA' becomes 'ReqA-1', 'ReqA-2', and so on.) as multiple jobs with the same company, language_code and requisition_id are not allowed. If the original requisition_id must be preserved, a custom field should be used for storage. It is also suggested to group the locations that close to each other in the same job for better search experience. Jobs with multiple addresses must have their addresses with the same LocationType to allow location filtering to work properly. (For example, a Job with addresses "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA, USA" and "London, UK" may not have location filters applied correctly at search time since the first is a LocationType.STREET_ADDRESS and the second is a LocationType.LOCALITY.)

// Strongly recommended for the best service experience. The expiration timestamp of the job. After this timestamp, the job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The expired job can't be listed by the ListJobs API, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or updated with the UpdateJob API or deleted with the DeleteJob API. An expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration timestamp. Updating an expired job fails if there is another existing open job with same company, language_code and requisition_id. The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum number of open jobs over previous 7 days. If this threshold is exceeded, expired jobs are cleaned out in order of earliest expire time. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. Invalid timestamps are ignored, and treated as expire time not provided. If the timestamp is before the instant request is made, the job is treated as expired immediately on creation. This kind of job can not be updated. And when creating a job with past timestamp, the posting_publish_time must be set before posting_expire_time. The purpose of this feature is to allow other objects, such as Application, to refer a job that didn't exist in the system prior to becoming expired. If you want to modify a job that was expired on creation, delete it and create a new one. If this value isn't provided at the time of job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job's creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value isn't provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_mask. If the field masks include job_end_time, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job's last update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn't updated.
