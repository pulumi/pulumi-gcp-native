	// Optional. Options that affect sinks exporting data to BigQuery.
	BigqueryOptions BigQueryOptionsResponseOutput `pulumi:"bigqueryOptions"`
	// The creation timestamp of the sink.This field may not be present for older sinks.
	CreateTime pulumi.StringOutput `pulumi:"createTime"`
	// Optional. A description of this sink. The maximum length of the description is 8000 characters.
	Description pulumi.StringOutput `pulumi:"description"`
	// Required. The export destination: "storage.googleapis.com/[GCS_BUCKET]" "bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/datasets/[DATASET]" "pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/topics/[TOPIC_ID]" The sink's writer_identity, set when the sink is created, must have permission to write to the destination or else the log entries are not exported. For more information, see Exporting Logs with Sinks (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/api/tasks/exporting-logs).
	Destination pulumi.StringOutput `pulumi:"destination"`
	// Optional. If set to True, then this sink is disabled and it does not export any log entries.
	Disabled pulumi.BoolOutput `pulumi:"disabled"`
	// Optional. Log entries that match any of the exclusion filters will not be exported. If a log entry is matched by both filter and one of exclusion_filters it will not be exported.
	Exclusions LogExclusionResponseArrayOutput `pulumi:"exclusions"`
	// Optional. An advanced logs filter (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced-queries). The only exported log entries are those that are in the resource owning the sink and that match the filter. For example: logName="projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]" AND severity>=ERROR

If the field is true, then logs from all the projects, folders, and billing accounts contained in the sink's parent resource are also available for export. Whether a particular log entry from the children is exported depends on the sink's filter expression. For example, if this field is true, then the filter resource.type=gce_instance would export all Compute Engine VM instance log entries from all projects in the sink's parent. To only export entries from certain child projects, filter on the project part of the log name: logName:("projects/test-project1/" OR "projects/test-project2/") AND resource.type=gce_instance
	IncludeChildren pulumi.BoolOutput `pulumi:"includeChildren"`
	// Required. The client-assigned sink identifier, unique within the project. Example: "my-syslog-errors-to-pubsub". Sink identifiers are limited to 100 characters and can include only the following characters: upper and lower-case alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, and periods. First character has to be alphanumeric.
	Name pulumi.StringOutput `pulumi:"name"`
	// The last update timestamp of the sink.This field may not be present for older sinks.
	UpdateTime pulumi.StringOutput `pulumi:"updateTime"`
	// An IAM identity—a service account or group—under which Logging writes the exported log entries to the sink's destination. This field is set by sinks.create and sinks.update based on the value of unique_writer_identity in those methods.Until you grant this identity write-access to the destination, log entry exports from this sink will fail.
