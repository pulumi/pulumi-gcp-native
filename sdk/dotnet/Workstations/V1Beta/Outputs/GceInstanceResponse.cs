If using a custom container image, the service account must have permissions to pull the specified image. If you as the administrator want to be able to `ssh` into the underlying VM, you need to set this value to a service account for which you have the `iam.serviceAccounts.actAs` permission. Conversely, if you don't want anyone to be able to `ssh` into the underlying VM, use a service account where no one has that permission. If not set, VMs run with a service account provided by the Cloud Workstations service, and the image must be publicly accessible.
