Can't be set to `RENEWAL_DISABLED` during resource creation and can only be updated when the `Registration` resource has state `ACTIVE` or `SUSPENDED`. When `preferred_renewal_method` is set to `AUTOMATIC_RENEWAL` the actual `renewal_method` can be set to `RENEWAL_DISABLED` in case of e.g. problems with the Billing Account or reported domain abuse. In such cases check the `issues` field on the `Registration`. After the problem is resolved the `renewal_method` will be automatically updated to `preferred_renewal_method` in a few hours.
