If a model is not explicitly specified, then we auto-select a model based on the parameters in the InputAudioConfig. If enhanced speech model is enabled for the agent and an enhanced version of the specified model for the language does not exist, then the speech is recognized using the standard version of the specified model. Refer to [Cloud Speech API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/basics#select-model) for more details. If you specify a model, the following models typically have the best performance: - phone_call (best for Agent Assist and telephony) - latest_short (best for Dialogflow non-telephony) - command_and_search (best for very short utterances and commands)
