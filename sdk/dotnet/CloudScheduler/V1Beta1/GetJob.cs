The schedule can be either of the following types: * [Crontab](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#Overview) * English-like [schedule](https://cloud.google.com/scheduler/docs/configuring/cron-job-schedules) As a general rule, execution `n + 1` of a job will not begin until execution `n` has finished. Cloud Scheduler will never allow two simultaneously outstanding executions. For example, this implies that if the `n+1`th execution is scheduled to run at 16:00 but the `n`th execution takes until 16:15, the `n+1`th execution will not start until `16:15`. A scheduled start time will be delayed if the previous execution has not ended when its scheduled time occurs. If retry_count &gt; 0 and a job attempt fails, the job will be tried a total of retry_count times, with exponential backoff, until the next scheduled start time.
