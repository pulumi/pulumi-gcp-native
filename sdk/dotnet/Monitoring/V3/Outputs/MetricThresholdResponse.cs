When choosing a duration, it is useful to keep in mind the frequency of the underlying time series data (which may also be affected by any alignments specified in the aggregations field); a good duration is long enough so that a single outlier does not generate spurious alerts, but short enough that unhealthy states are detected and alerted on quickly.
