The 255-byte limit is recommended by this thread (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1592291/what-is-the-email-subject-length-limit). It is both the limit imposed by some third-party ticketing products and it is common to define textual fields in databases as VARCHAR(255).The contents of the subject line can be templatized by using variables (https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/alerts/doc-variables). If this field is missing or empty, a default subject line will be generated.
