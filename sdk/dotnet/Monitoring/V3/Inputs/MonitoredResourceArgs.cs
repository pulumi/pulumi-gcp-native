Examples include virtual machine instances, databases, and storage devices such as disks. The type field identifies a MonitoredResourceDescriptor object that describes the resource's schema. Information in the labels field identifies the actual resource and its attributes according to the schema. For example, a particular Compute Engine VM instance could be represented by the following object, because the MonitoredResourceDescriptor for "gce_instance" has labels "project_id", "instance_id" and "zone": { "type": "gce_instance", "labels": { "project_id": "my-project", "instance_id": "12345678901234", "zone": "us-central1-a" }}
