The service controller handles two things: - **What is allowed:** for each API request, Chemist checks the project status, activation status, abuse status, billing status, service status, location restrictions, VPC Service Controls, SuperQuota, and other policies. - **What has happened:** for each API response, Chemist reports the telemetry data to analytics, auditing, billing, eventing, logging, monitoring, sawmill, and tracing. Chemist also accepts telemetry data not associated with API traffic, such as billing metrics. Example: control: environment: servicecontrol.googleapis.com
