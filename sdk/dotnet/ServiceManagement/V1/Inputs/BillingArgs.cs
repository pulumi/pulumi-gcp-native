The following example shows how to configure monitored resources and metrics for billing, `consumer_destinations` is the only supported destination and the monitored resources need at least one label key `cloud.googleapis.com/location` to indicate the location of the billing usage, using different monitored resources between monitoring and billing is recommended so they can be evolved independently: monitored_resources: - type: library.googleapis.com/billing_branch labels: - key: cloud.googleapis.com/location description: | Predefined label to support billing location restriction. - key: city description: | Custom label to define the city where the library branch is located in. - key: name description: Custom label to define the name of the library branch. metrics: - name: library.googleapis.com/book/borrowed_count metric_kind: DELTA value_type: INT64 unit: "1" billing: consumer_destinations: - monitored_resource: library.googleapis.com/billing_branch metrics: - library.googleapis.com/book/borrowed_count
