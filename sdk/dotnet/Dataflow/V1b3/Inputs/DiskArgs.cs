If SSD persistent disks are available, the resource name typically ends with "pd-ssd". The actual valid values are defined the Google Compute Engine API, not by the Cloud Dataflow API; consult the Google Compute Engine documentation for more information about determining the set of available disk types for a particular project and zone.
