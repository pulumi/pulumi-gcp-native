In this field, you can reference [environment variables set by AI Platform Prediction](/ai-platform/prediction/docs/custom-container-requirements#aip-variables) and environment variables set earlier in the same env field as where this message occurs. You cannot reference environment variables set in the Docker image. In order for environment variables to be expanded, reference them by using the following syntax: $(VARIABLE_NAME) Note that this differs from Bash variable expansion, which does not use parentheses. If a variable cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string is used unchanged. To avoid variable expansion, you can escape this syntax with `$$`; for example: $$(VARIABLE_NAME)
