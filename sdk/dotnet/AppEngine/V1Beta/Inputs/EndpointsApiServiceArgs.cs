This means that Endpoints starts up with a particular configuration ID. When a new configuration is rolled out, Endpoints must be given the new configuration ID. The config_id field is used to give the configuration ID and is required in this case.Endpoints also has a rollout strategy called RolloutStrategy.MANAGED. When using this, Endpoints fetches the latest configuration and does not need the configuration ID. In this case, config_id must be omitted.
