    /// An IAM service account. A service account is an account for an application or a virtual machine (VM) instance, not a person. You can use a service account to call Google APIs. To learn more, read the [overview of service accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/service-accounts/overview). When you create a service account, you specify the project ID that owns the service account, as well as a name that must be unique within the project. IAM uses these values to create an email address that identifies the service account.

        /// <summary>
        /// The resource name of the service account. Use one of the following formats: * `projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{EMAIL_ADDRESS}` * `projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{UNIQUE_ID}` As an alternative, you can use the `-` wildcard character instead of the project ID: * `projects/-/serviceAccounts/{EMAIL_ADDRESS}` * `projects/-/serviceAccounts/{UNIQUE_ID}` When possible, avoid using the `-` wildcard character, because it can cause response messages to contain misleading error codes. For example, if you try to get the service account `projects/-/serviceAccounts/fake@example.com`, which does not exist, the response contains an HTTP `403 Forbidden` error instead of a `404 Not Found` error.
