For example if a SecurityAction has the following: ip_address_ranges: ["ip1", "ip2"] and bot_reasons: ["Flooder", "Robot Abuser"] then this is interpreted as: enforce the action if the incoming request has ((ip_address_ranges = "ip1" OR ip_address_ranges = "ip2") AND (bot_reasons="Flooder" OR bot_reasons="Robot Abuser")). Conditions other than ip_address_ranges and bot_reasons cannot be ANDed.
