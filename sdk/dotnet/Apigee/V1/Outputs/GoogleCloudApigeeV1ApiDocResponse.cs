    /// `ApiDoc` represents an API catalog item. Catalog items are used in two ways in a portal: - Users can browse and interact with a visual representation of the API documentation - The `api_product_name` field provides a link to a backing [API product] (/apigee/docs/reference/apis/apigee/rest/v1/organizations.apiproducts). Through this link, portal users can create and manage developer apps linked to one or more API products.
