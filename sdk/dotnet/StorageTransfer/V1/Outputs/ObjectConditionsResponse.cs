    /// Conditions that determine which objects are transferred. Applies only to Cloud Data Sources such as S3, Azure, and Cloud Storage. The "last modification time" refers to the time of the last change to the object's content or metadata â€” specifically, this is the `updated` property of Cloud Storage objects, the `LastModified` field of S3 objects, and the `Last-Modified` header of Azure blobs. Transfers with a PosixFilesystem source or destination don't support `ObjectConditions`.

Objects must not start with one of the matching `exclude_prefixes` for inclusion in a transfer. The following are requirements of `exclude_prefixes`: * Each exclude-prefix can contain any sequence of Unicode characters, to a max length of 1024 bytes when UTF8-encoded, and must not contain Carriage Return or Line Feed characters. Wildcard matching and regular expression matching are not supported. * Each exclude-prefix must omit the leading slash. For example, to exclude the object `s3://my-aws-bucket/logs/y=2015/requests.gz`, specify the exclude-prefix as `logs/y=2015/requests.gz`. * None of the exclude-prefix values can be empty, if specified. * Each exclude-prefix must exclude a distinct portion of the object namespace. No exclude-prefix may be a prefix of another exclude-prefix. * If include_prefixes is specified, then each exclude-prefix must start with the value of a path explicitly included by `include_prefixes`. The max size of `exclude_prefixes` is 1000. For more information, see [Filtering objects from transfers](/storage-transfer/docs/filtering-objects-from-transfers).
