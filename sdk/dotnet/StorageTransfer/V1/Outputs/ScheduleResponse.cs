If `schedule_start_date` and start_time_of_day are in the past relative to the job's creation time, the transfer starts the day after you schedule the transfer request. **Note:** When starting jobs at or near midnight UTC it is possible that a job starts later than expected. For example, if you send an outbound request on June 1 one millisecond prior to midnight UTC and the Storage Transfer Service server receives the request on June 2, then it creates a TransferJob with `schedule_start_date` set to June 2 and a `start_time_of_day` set to midnight UTC. The first scheduled TransferOperation takes place on June 3 at midnight UTC.

If `start_time_of_day` is specified: * One-time transfers run at the specified time. * Recurring transfers run at the specified time each day, through `schedule_end_date`.
