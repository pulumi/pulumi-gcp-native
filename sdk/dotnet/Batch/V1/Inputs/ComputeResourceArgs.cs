If you also define the VM's machine type using the `machineType` in [InstancePolicy](https://cloud.google.com/batch/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.jobs#instancepolicy) field or inside the `instanceTemplate` in the [InstancePolicyOrTemplate](https://cloud.google.com/batch/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.jobs#instancepolicyortemplate) field, make sure the CPU resources for both fields are compatible with each other and with how many tasks you want to allow to run on the same VM at the same time. For example, if you specify the `n2-standard-2` machine type, which has 2 vCPUs each, you are recommended to set `cpuMilli` no more than `2000`, or you are recommended to run two tasks on the same VM if you set `cpuMilli` to `1000` or less.
