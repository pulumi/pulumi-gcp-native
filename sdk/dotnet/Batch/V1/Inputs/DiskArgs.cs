The following image values are supported for a boot disk: * `batch-debian`: use Batch Debian images. * `batch-centos`: use Batch CentOS images. * `batch-cos`: use Batch Container-Optimized images. * `batch-hpc-centos`: use Batch HPC CentOS images. * `batch-hpc-rocky`: use Batch HPC Rocky Linux images.

If the `type` specifies a local SSD, this field should be a multiple of 375 GB, otherwise, the final size will be the next greater multiple of 375 GB. **Boot Disk**: Batch will calculate the boot disk size based on source image and task requirements if you do not speicify the size. If both this field and the `boot_disk_mib` field in task spec's `compute_resource` are defined, Batch will only honor this field. Also, this field should be no smaller than the source disk's size when the `data_source` is set as `snapshot` or `image`. For example, if you set an image as the `data_source` field and the image's default disk size 30 GB, you can only use this field to make the disk larger or equal to 30 GB.
