Use Image streaming to allow the runnable to initialize without waiting for the entire container image to download, which can significantly reduce startup time for large container images. When `enableImageStreaming` is set to true, the container runtime is [containerd](https://containerd.io/) instead of Docker. Additionally, this container runnable only supports the following `container` subfields: `imageUri`, `commands[]`, `entrypoint`, and `volumes[]`; any other `container` subfields are ignored. For more information about the requirements and limitations for using Image streaming with Batch, see the [`image-streaming` sample on GitHub](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/batch-samples/tree/main/api-samples/image-streaming).
