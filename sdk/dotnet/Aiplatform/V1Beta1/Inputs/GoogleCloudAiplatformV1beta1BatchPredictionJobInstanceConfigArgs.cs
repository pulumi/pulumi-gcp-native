The order of columns is determined by the BigQuery column order, unless included_fields is populated. included_fields must be populated for specifying field orders. * For `jsonl`, if each line of the JSONL input is an object, included_fields must be populated for specifying field orders. * Does not apply to `csv`, `file-list`, `tf-record`, or `tf-record-gzip`. If not specified, Vertex AI converts the batch prediction input as follows: * For `bigquery` and `csv`, the behavior is the same as `array`. The order of columns is the same as defined in the file or table, unless included_fields is populated. * For `jsonl`, the prediction instance format is determined by each line of the input. * For `tf-record`/`tf-record-gzip`, each record will be converted to an object in the format of `{"b64": }`, where `` is the Base64-encoded string of the content of the record. * For `file-list`, each file in the list will be converted to an object in the format of `{"b64": }`, where `` is the Base64-encoded string of the content of the file.
