    /// Assigns input data to the training, validation, and test sets so that the distribution of values found in the categorical column (as specified by the `key` field) is mirrored within each split. The fraction values determine the relative sizes of the splits. For example, if the specified column has three values, with 50% of the rows having value "A", 25% value "B", and 25% value "C", and the split fractions are specified as 80/10/10, then the training set will constitute 80% of the training data, with about 50% of the training set rows having the value "A" for the specified column, about 25% having the value "B", and about 25% having the value "C". Only the top 500 occurring values are used; any values not in the top 500 values are randomly assigned to a split. If less than three rows contain a specific value, those rows are randomly assigned. Supported only for tabular Datasets.
