In the dataset two tables will be created, `predictions`, and `errors`. If the Model has both instance and prediction schemata defined then the tables have columns as follows: The `predictions` table contains instances for which the prediction succeeded, it has columns as per a concatenation of the Model's instance and prediction schemata. The `errors` table contains rows for which the prediction has failed, it has instance columns, as per the instance schema, followed by a single "errors" column, which as values has google.rpc.Status represented as a STRUCT, and containing only `code` and `message`.
