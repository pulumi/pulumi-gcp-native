If max_replica_count is not set, the default value is min_replica_count. The max allowed replica count is 1000. Available machine types for SMALL shard: e2-standard-2 and all machine types available for MEDIUM and LARGE shard. Available machine types for MEDIUM shard: e2-standard-16 and all machine types available for LARGE shard. Available machine types for LARGE shard: e2-highmem-16, n2d-standard-32. n1-standard-16 and n1-standard-32 are still available, but we recommend e2-standard-16 and e2-highmem-16 for cost efficiency.

Creating `deployment_groups` with `reserved_ip_ranges` is a recommended practice when the peered network has multiple peering ranges. This creates your deployments from predictable IP spaces for easier traffic administration. Also, one deployment_group (except 'default') can only be used with the same reserved_ip_ranges which means if the deployment_group has been used with reserved_ip_ranges: [a, b, c], using it with [a, b] or [d, e] is disallowed. Note: we only support up to 5 deployment groups(not including 'default').
