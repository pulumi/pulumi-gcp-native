    /// Config for SmoothGrad approximation of gradients. When enabled, the gradients are approximated by averaging the gradients from noisy samples in the vicinity of the inputs. Adding noise can help improve the computed gradients. Refer to this paper for more details: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03825.pdf

Use this field when all features are normalized to have the same distribution: scale to range [0, 1], [-1, 1] or z-scoring, where features are normalized to have 0-mean and 1-variance. Learn more about [normalization](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/data-prep/transform/normalization). For best results the recommended value is about 10% - 20% of the standard deviation of the input feature. Refer to section 3.2 of the SmoothGrad paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03825.pdf. Defaults to 0.1. If the distribution is different per feature, set feature_noise_sigma instead for each feature.
