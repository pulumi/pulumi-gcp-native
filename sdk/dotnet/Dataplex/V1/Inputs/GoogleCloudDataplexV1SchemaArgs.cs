You will get the full service provided by Dataplex discovery, including new data discovery, schema inference and schema evolution. You can still provide input the schema of the entities, for example renaming a schema field, changing CSV or Json options if you think the discovered values are not as accurate. Dataplex will consider your input as the initial schema (as if they were produced by the previous discovery run), and will evolve schema or flag actions based on that. - Set user_manage to true if you would like to fully manage the entity schema by yourself. This is useful when you would like to manually specify the schema for a table. In this case, the schema defined by the user is guaranteed to be kept unchanged and would not be overwritten. But this also means Dataplex will not provide schema evolution management for you. Dataplex will still be able to manage partition registration (i.e., keeping the list of partitions up to date) when Dataplex discovery is turned on and user_managed is set to true.
