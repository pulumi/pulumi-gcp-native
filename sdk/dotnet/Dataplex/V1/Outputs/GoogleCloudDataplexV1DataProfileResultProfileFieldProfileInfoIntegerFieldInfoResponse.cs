Three main quartiles used are: The first quartile (Q1) splits off the lowest 25% of data from the highest 75%. It is also known as the lower or 25th empirical quartile, as 25% of the data is below this point. The second quartile (Q2) is the median of a data set. So, 50% of the data lies below this point. The third quartile (Q3) splits off the highest 25% of data from the lowest 75%. It is known as the upper or 75th empirical quartile, as 75% of the data lies below this point. So, here the quartiles is provided as an ordered list of quartile values, occurring in order Q1, median, Q3.
