Encryption operations that are in progress will be completed with the key that was in use when they started. Decryption operations will be completed using the key that was used at the time of encryption unless access to that key has been revoked.To disable CMEK for the Log Router, set this field to an empty string.See Enabling CMEK for Log Router (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/routing/managed-encryption) for more information.
