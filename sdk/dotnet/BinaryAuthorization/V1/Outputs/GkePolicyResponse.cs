        /// Optional. The `CheckSet` objects to apply, scoped by namespace or namespace and service account. Exactly one `CheckSet` will be evaluated for a given Pod (unless the list is empty, in which case the behavior is "always allow"). If multiple `CheckSet` objects have scopes that match the namespace and service account of the Pod being evaluated, only the `CheckSet` with the MOST SPECIFIC scope will match. `CheckSet` objects must be listed in order of decreasing specificity, i.e. if a scope matches a given service account (which must include the namespace), it must come before a `CheckSet` with a scope matching just that namespace. This property is enforced by server-side validation. The purpose of this restriction is to ensure that if more than one `CheckSet` matches a given Pod, the `CheckSet` that will be evaluated will always be the first in the list to match (because if any other matches, it must be less specific). If `check_sets` is empty, the default behavior is to allow all images. If `check_sets` is non-empty, the last `check_sets` entry must always be a `CheckSet` with no scope set, i.e. a catchall to handle any situation not caught by the preceding `CheckSet` objects.
