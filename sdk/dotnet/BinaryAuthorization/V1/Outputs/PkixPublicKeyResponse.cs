This may be explicitly provided by the caller, but it MUST be a valid RFC3986 URI. If `key_id` is left blank and this `PkixPublicKey` is not used in the context of a wrapper (see next paragraph), a default key ID will be computed based on the digest of the DER encoding of the public key. If this `PkixPublicKey` is used in the context of a wrapper that has its own notion of key ID (e.g. `AttestorPublicKey`), then this field can either: * Match that value exactly. * Or be left blank, in which case it behaves exactly as though it is equal to that wrapper value.
