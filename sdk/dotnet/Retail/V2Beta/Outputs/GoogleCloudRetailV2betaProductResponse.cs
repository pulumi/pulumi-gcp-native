Features that can take on one of a limited number of possible values. Two types of features can be set are: Textual features. some examples would be the brand/maker of a product, or country of a customer. Numerical features. Some examples would be the height/weight of a product, or age of a customer. For example: `{ "vendor": {"text": ["vendor123", "vendor456"]}, "lengths_cm": {"numbers":[2.3, 15.4]}, "heights_cm": {"numbers":[8.1, 6.4]} }`. This field needs to pass all below criteria, otherwise an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned: * Max entries count: 200. * The key must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 128 characters. * For indexable attribute, the key must match the pattern: `a-zA-Z0-9*`. For example, `key0LikeThis` or `KEY_1_LIKE_THIS`. * For text attributes, at most 400 values are allowed. Empty values are not allowed. Each value must be a non-empty UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 256 characters. * For number attributes, at most 400 values are allowed.
