    /// Force returns an attribute/facet in the request around a certain position or above. * Rule Condition: Must specify non-empty Condition.query_terms (for search only) or Condition.page_categories (for browse only), but can't specify both. * Action Inputs: attribute name, position * Action Result: Will force return a facet key around a certain position or above if the condition is satisfied. Example: Suppose the query is "shoes", the Condition.query_terms is "shoes", the ForceReturnFacetAction.FacetPositionAdjustment.attribute_name is "size" and the ForceReturnFacetAction.FacetPositionAdjustment.position is 8. Two cases: a) The facet key "size" is not already in the top 8 slots, then the facet "size" will appear at a position close to 8. b) The facet key "size" in among the top 8 positions in the request, then it will stay at its current rank.
