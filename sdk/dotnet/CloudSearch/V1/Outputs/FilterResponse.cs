    /// A generic way of expressing filters in a query, which supports two approaches: **1. Setting a ValueFilter.** The name must match an operator_name defined in the schema for your data source. **2. Setting a CompositeFilter.** The filters are evaluated using the logical operator. The top-level operators can only be either an AND or a NOT. AND can appear only at the top-most level. OR can appear only under a top-level AND.
