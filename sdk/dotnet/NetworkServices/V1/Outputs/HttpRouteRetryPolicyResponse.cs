Valid values are: 5xx: Proxy will attempt a retry if the destination service responds with any 5xx response code, of if the destination service does not respond at all, example: disconnect, reset, read timeout, connection failure and refused streams. gateway-error: Similar to 5xx, but only applies to response codes 502, 503, 504. reset: Proxy will attempt a retry if the destination service does not respond at all (disconnect/reset/read timeout) connect-failure: Proxy will retry on failures connecting to destination for example due to connection timeouts. retriable-4xx: Proxy will retry fro retriable 4xx response codes. Currently the only retriable error supported is 409. refused-stream: Proxy will retry if the destination resets the stream with a REFUSED_STREAM error code. This reset type indicates that it is safe to retry.
