These headers represent a subset of the headers that will be configured for the task's HTTP request. Some HTTP request headers will be ignored or replaced. A partial list of headers that will be ignored or replaced is: * Several predefined headers, prefixed with "X-Google-Cloud-Tasks-", can be used to define properties of the task. * Host: This will be computed by Cloud Tasks and derived from HttpRequest.url. * Content-Length: This will be computed by Cloud Tasks. `Content-Type` won't be set by Cloud Tasks. You can explicitly set `Content-Type` to a media type when the task is created. For example,`Content-Type` can be set to `"application/octet-stream"` or `"application/json"`. The default value is set to "application/json"`. * User-Agent: This will be set to `"Google-Cloud-Tasks"`. Headers which can have multiple values (according to RFC2616) can be specified using comma-separated values. The size of the headers must be less than 80KB. Queue-level headers to override headers of all the tasks in the queue.
