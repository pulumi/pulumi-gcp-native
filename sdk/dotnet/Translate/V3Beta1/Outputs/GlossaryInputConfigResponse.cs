API returns [google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT] for unsupported URI-s and file formats. Wildcards are not allowed. This must be a single file in one of the following formats: For unidirectional glossaries: - TSV/CSV (`.tsv`/`.csv`): 2 column file, tab- or comma-separated. The first column is source text. The second column is target text. The file must not contain headers. That is, the first row is data, not column names. - TMX (`.tmx`): TMX file with parallel data defining source/target term pairs. For equivalent term sets glossaries: - CSV (`.csv`): Multi-column CSV file defining equivalent glossary terms in multiple languages. See documentation for more information - [glossaries](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/advanced/glossary).
