The following service accounts need to be granted the role 'Cloud KMS CryptoKey Encrypter/Decrypter (roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter)' on the Key/KeyRing/Project/Organization (least access preferred). 1. Google Cloud Functions service account (service-{project_number}@gcf-admin-robot.iam.gserviceaccount.com) - Required to protect the function's image. 2. Google Storage service account (service-{project_number}@gs-project-accounts.iam.gserviceaccount.com) - Required to protect the function's source code. If this service account does not exist, deploying a function without a KMS key or retrieving the service agent name provisions it. For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/projects#service-agents and https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/getting-service-agent#gsutil. Google Cloud Functions delegates access to service agents to protect function resources in internal projects that are not accessible by the end user.
