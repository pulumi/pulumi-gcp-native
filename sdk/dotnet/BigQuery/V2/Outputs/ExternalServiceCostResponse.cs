Moreover, this field only track external service costs that will show up as BigQuery costs (e.g. training BigQuery ML job with google cloud CAIP or Automl Tables services), not other costs which may be accrued by running the query (e.g. reading from Bigtable or Cloud Storage). The external service costs with different billing sku (e.g. CAIP job is charged based on VM usage) are converted to BigQuery billed_bytes and slot_ms with equivalent amount of US dollars. Services may not directly correlate to these metrics, but these are the equivalents for billing purposes. Output only.
