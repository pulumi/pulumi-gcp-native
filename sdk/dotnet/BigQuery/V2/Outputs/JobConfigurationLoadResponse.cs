If none of the listed types supports the precision and the scale, the type supporting the widest range in the specified list is picked, and if a value exceeds the supported range when reading the data, an error will be thrown. Example: Suppose the value of this field is ["NUMERIC", "BIGNUMERIC"]. If (precision,scale) is: * (38,9) -&gt; NUMERIC; * (39,9) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 30 integer digits); * (38,10) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 10 fractional digits); * (76,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC; * (77,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (error if value exeeds supported range). This field cannot contain duplicate types. The order of the types in this field is ignored. For example, ["BIGNUMERIC", "NUMERIC"] is the same as ["NUMERIC", "BIGNUMERIC"] and NUMERIC always takes precedence over BIGNUMERIC. Defaults to ["NUMERIC", "STRING"] for ORC and ["NUMERIC"] for the other file formats.

Generally, your data loads successfully, but it may not match byte-for-byte what you expect. To avoid this, specify the correct encoding by using the `--encoding` flag. If BigQuery can't convert a character other than the ASCII `0` character, BigQuery converts the character to the standard Unicode replacement character: ï¿½.
