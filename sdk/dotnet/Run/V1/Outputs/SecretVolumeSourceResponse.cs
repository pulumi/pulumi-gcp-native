Directories within the path are not affected by this setting. This might be in conflict with other options that affect the file mode, like fsGroup, and the result can be other mode bits set. NOTE: This is an integer representation of the mode bits. So, the integer value should look exactly as the chmod numeric notation, i.e. Unix chmod "777" (a=rwx) should have the integer value 777.
