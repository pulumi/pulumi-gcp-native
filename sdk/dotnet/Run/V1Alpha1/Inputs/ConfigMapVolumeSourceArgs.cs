Directories within the path are not affected by this setting. Notes * Internally, a umask of 0222 will be applied to any non-zero value. * This is an integer representation of the mode bits. So, the octal integer value should look exactly as the chmod numeric notation with a leading zero. Some examples: for chmod 777 (a=rwx), set to 0777 (octal) or 511 (base-10). For chmod 640 (u=rw,g=r), set to 0640 (octal) or 416 (base-10). For chmod 755 (u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx), set to 0755 (octal) or 493 (base-10). * This might be in conflict with other options that affect the file mode, like fsGroup, and the result can be other mode bits set.
