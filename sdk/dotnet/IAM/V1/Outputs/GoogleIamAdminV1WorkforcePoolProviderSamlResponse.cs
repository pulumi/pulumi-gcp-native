The xml document should comply with [SAML 2.0 specification](https://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-metadata-2.0-os.pdf). The max size of the acceptable xml document will be bounded to 128k characters. The metadata xml document should satisfy the following constraints: 1) Must contain an Identity Provider Entity ID. 2) Must contain at least one non-expired signing key certificate. 3) For each signing key: a) Valid from should be no more than 7 days from now. b) Valid to should be no more than 14 years in the future. 4) Up to 3 IdP signing keys are allowed in the metadata xml. When updating the provider's metadata xml, at least one non-expired signing key must overlap with the existing metadata. This requirement is skipped if there are no non-expired signing keys present in the existing metadata.
