The XML document must comply with the [SAML 2.0 specification](https://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-metadata-2.0-os.pdf). The maximum size of an acceptable XML document is 128K characters. The SAML metadata XML document must satisfy the following constraints: * Must contain an IdP Entity ID. * Must contain at least one non-expired signing certificate. * For each signing certificate, the expiration must be: * From no more than 7 days in the future. * To no more than 15 years in the future. * Up to three IdP signing keys are allowed. When updating the provider's metadata XML, at least one non-expired signing key must overlap with the existing metadata. This requirement is skipped if there are no non-expired signing keys present in the existing metadata.
