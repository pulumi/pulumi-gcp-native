This field may be empty if `key_id` references an external key. For Cloud Build based signatures, this is a PEM encoded public key. To verify the Cloud Build signature, place the contents of this field into a file (public.pem). The signature field is base64-decoded into its binary representation in signature.bin, and the provenance bytes from `BuildDetails` are base64-decoded into a binary representation in signed.bin. OpenSSL can then verify the signature: `openssl sha256 -verify public.pem -signature signature.bin signed.bin`
