If a policy for an error code is not configured for the PathRule, a policy for the error code configured in pathMatcher.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is applied. If one is not specified in pathMatcher.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy, the policy configured in UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. For example, consider a UrlMap with the following configuration: - UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy are configured with policies for 5xx and 4xx errors - A PathRule for /coming_soon/ is configured for the error code 404. If the request is for www.myotherdomain.com and a 404 is encountered, the policy under UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. If a 404 response is encountered for the request www.example.com/current_events/, the pathMatcher's policy takes effect. If however, the request for www.example.com/coming_soon/ encounters a 404, the policy in PathRule.customErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. If any of the requests in this example encounter a 500 error code, the policy at UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. customErrorResponsePolicy is supported only for Global External HTTP(S) load balancing.
