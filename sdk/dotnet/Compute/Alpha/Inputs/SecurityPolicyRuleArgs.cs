The following are the valid actions: - allow: allow access to target. - deny(): deny access to target, returns the HTTP response code specified (valid values are 403, 404, and 502). - rate_based_ban: limit client traffic to the configured threshold and ban the client if the traffic exceeds the threshold. Configure parameters for this action in RateLimitOptions. Requires rate_limit_options to be set. - redirect: redirect to a different target. This can either be an internal reCAPTCHA redirect, or an external URL-based redirect via a 302 response. Parameters for this action can be configured via redirectOptions. - throttle: limit client traffic to the configured threshold. Configure parameters for this action in rateLimitOptions.

        /// A match condition that incoming packets are evaluated against for CLOUD_ARMOR_NETWORK security policies. If it matches, the corresponding 'action' is enforced. The match criteria for a rule consists of built-in match fields (like 'srcIpRanges') and potentially multiple user-defined match fields ('userDefinedFields'). Field values may be extracted directly from the packet or derived from it (e.g. 'srcRegionCodes'). Some fields may not be present in every packet (e.g. 'srcPorts'). A user-defined field is only present if the base header is found in the packet and the entire field is in bounds. Each match field may specify which values can match it, listing one or more ranges, prefixes, or exact values that are considered a match for the field. A field value must be present in order to match a specified match field. If no match values are specified for a match field, then any field value is considered to match it, and it's not required to be present. For strings specifying '*' is also equivalent to match all. For a packet to match a rule, all specified match fields must match the corresponding field values derived from the packet. Example: networkMatch: srcIpRanges: - "192.0.2.0/24" - "198.51.100.0/24" userDefinedFields: - name: "ipv4_fragment_offset" values: - "1-0x1fff" The above match condition matches packets with a source IP in 192.0.2.0/24 or 198.51.100.0/24 and a user-defined field named "ipv4_fragment_offset" with a value between 1 and 0x1fff inclusive.
