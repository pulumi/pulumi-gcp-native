Similarly requests from clients can be aborted by the load balancer for a percentage of requests. timeout and retry_policy is ignored by clients that are configured with a fault_injection_policy if: 1. The traffic is generated by fault injection AND 2. The fault injection is not a delay fault injection. Fault injection is not supported with the classic Application Load Balancer .
