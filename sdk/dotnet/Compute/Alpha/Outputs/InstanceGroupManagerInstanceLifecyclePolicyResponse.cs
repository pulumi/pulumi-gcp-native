The Instance Group Manager will wait for a signal that indicates successful initialization before stopping / suspending an instance.

Instead, an error will be visible in the lastAttempt.errors field of the managed instance in the listmanagedinstances method. If metadataBasedReadinessSignal.timeoutSec is unset, the Instance Group Manager will directly proceed to suspend / stop instances, skipping initialization on them.
