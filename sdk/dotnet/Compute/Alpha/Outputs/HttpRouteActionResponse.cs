As part of fault injection, when clients send requests to a backend service, delays can be introduced by a load balancer on a percentage of requests before sending those requests to the backend service. Similarly requests from clients can be aborted by the load balancer for a percentage of requests. timeout and retry_policy is ignored by clients that are configured with a fault_injection_policy if: 1. The traffic is generated by fault injection AND 2. The fault injection is not a delay fault injection. Fault injection is not supported with the global external HTTP(S) load balancer (classic). To see which load balancers support fault injection, see Load balancing: Routing and traffic management features.

A stream that does not complete in this duration is closed. If not specified, this field uses the maximum maxStreamDuration value among all backend services associated with the route.
