On failover or failback, this field indicates whether connection draining will be honored. Google Cloud has a fixed connection draining timeout of 10 minutes. A setting of true terminates existing TCP connections to the active pool during failover and failback, immediately draining traffic. A setting of false allows existing TCP connections to persist, even on VMs no longer in the active pool, for up to the duration of the connection draining timeout (10 minutes).
