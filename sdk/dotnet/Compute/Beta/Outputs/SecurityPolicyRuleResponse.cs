The following are the valid actions: - allow: allow access to target. - deny(): deny access to target, returns the HTTP response code specified (valid values are 403, 404, and 502). - rate_based_ban: limit client traffic to the configured threshold and ban the client if the traffic exceeds the threshold. Configure parameters for this action in RateLimitOptions. Requires rate_limit_options to be set. - redirect: redirect to a different target. This can either be an internal reCAPTCHA redirect, or an external URL-based redirect via a 302 response. Parameters for this action can be configured via redirectOptions. - throttle: limit client traffic to the configured threshold. Configure parameters for this action in rateLimitOptions. Requires rate_limit_options to be set for this.
