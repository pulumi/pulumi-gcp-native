Valid values are: - 5xx: Retry will be attempted if the instance or endpoint responds with any 5xx response code, or if the instance or endpoint does not respond at all, example: disconnects, reset, read timeout, connection failure, and refused streams. - gateway-error: Similar to 5xx, but only applies to response codes 502, 503 or 504. - - connect-failure: A retry will be attempted on failures connecting to the instance or endpoint, for example due to connection timeouts. - retriable-4xx: A retry will be attempted if the instance or endpoint responds with a retriable 4xx response code. Currently the only retriable error supported is 409. - refused-stream: A retry will be attempted if the instance or endpoint resets the stream with a REFUSED_STREAM error code. This reset type indicates that it is safe to retry. - cancelled: A retry will be attempted if the gRPC status code in the response header is set to cancelled. - deadline-exceeded: A retry will be attempted if the gRPC status code in the response header is set to deadline-exceeded. - internal: A retry will be attempted if the gRPC status code in the response header is set to internal. - resource-exhausted: A retry will be attempted if the gRPC status code in the response header is set to resource-exhausted. - unavailable: A retry will be attempted if the gRPC status code in the response header is set to unavailable.
