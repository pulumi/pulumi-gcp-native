    /// Message for detecting output from deidentification transformations such as [`CryptoReplaceFfxFpeConfig`](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/reference/rest/v2/organizations.deidentifyTemplates#cryptoreplaceffxfpeconfig). These types of transformations are those that perform pseudonymization, thereby producing a "surrogate" as output. This should be used in conjunction with a field on the transformation such as `surrogate_info_type`. This CustomInfoType does not support the use of `detection_rules`.
