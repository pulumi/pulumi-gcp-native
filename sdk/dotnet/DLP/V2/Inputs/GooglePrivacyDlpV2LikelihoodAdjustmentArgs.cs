For example, if a finding would be `POSSIBLE` without the detection rule and `relative_likelihood` is 1, then it is upgraded to `LIKELY`, while a value of -1 would downgrade it to `UNLIKELY`. Likelihood may never drop below `VERY_UNLIKELY` or exceed `VERY_LIKELY`, so applying an adjustment of 1 followed by an adjustment of -1 when base likelihood is `VERY_LIKELY` will result in a final likelihood of `LIKELY`.
