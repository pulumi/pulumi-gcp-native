If table_id is not set a new one will be generated for you with the following format: dlp_googleapis_yyyy_mm_dd_[dlp_job_id]. Pacific timezone will be used for generating the date details. For Inspect, each column in an existing output table must have the same name, type, and mode of a field in the `Finding` object. For Risk, an existing output table should be the output of a previous Risk analysis job run on the same source table, with the same privacy metric and quasi-identifiers. Risk jobs that analyze the same table but compute a different privacy metric, or use different sets of quasi-identifiers, cannot store their results in the same table.
