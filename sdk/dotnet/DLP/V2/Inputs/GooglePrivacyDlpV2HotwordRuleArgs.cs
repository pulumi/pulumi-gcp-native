The finding itself will be included in the window, so that hotwords can be used to match substrings of the finding itself. Suppose you want Cloud DLP to promote the likelihood of the phone number regex "\(\d{3}\) \d{3}-\d{4}" if the area code is known to be the area code of a company's office. In this case, use the hotword regex "\(xxx\)", where "xxx" is the area code in question. For tabular data, if you want to modify the likelihood of an entire column of findngs, see [Hotword example: Set the match likelihood of a table column] (https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/creating-custom-infotypes-likelihood#match-column-values).
