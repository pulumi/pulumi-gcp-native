        Adds a new Membership.

        :param str resource_name: The name of the resource.
        :param pulumi.ResourceOptions opts: Options for the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[pulumi.InputType['AuthorityArgs']] authority: Optional. How to identify workloads from this Membership. See the documentation on Workload Identity for more details: https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity
        :param pulumi.Input[str] create_time: Output only. When the Membership was created.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] delete_time: Output only. When the Membership was deleted.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] description: Output only. Description of this membership, limited to 63 characters. Must match the regex: `a-zA-Z0-9*` This field is present for legacy purposes.
        :param pulumi.Input[pulumi.InputType['MembershipEndpointArgs']] endpoint: Optional. Endpoint information to reach this member.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] external_id: Optional. An externally-generated and managed ID for this Membership. This ID may be modified after creation, but this is not recommended. The ID must match the regex: `a-zA-Z0-9*` If this Membership represents a Kubernetes cluster, this value should be set to the UID of the `kube-system` namespace object.
        :param pulumi.Input[Mapping[str, pulumi.Input[str]]] labels: Optional. GCP labels for this membership.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] last_connection_time: Output only. For clusters using Connect, the timestamp of the most recent connection established with Google Cloud. This time is updated every several minutes, not continuously. For clusters that do not use GKE Connect, or that have never connected successfully, this field will be unset.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] membership_id: Required. Client chosen ID for the membership. `membership_id` must be a valid RFC 1123 compliant DNS label: 1. At most 63 characters in length 2. It must consist of lower case alphanumeric characters or `-` 3. It must start and end with an alphanumeric character Which can be expressed as the regex: `[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?`, with a maximum length of 63 characters.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] name: Output only. The full, unique name of this Membership resource in the format `projects/*/locations/*/memberships/{membership_id}`, set during creation. `membership_id` must be a valid RFC 1123 compliant DNS label: 1. At most 63 characters in length 2. It must consist of lower case alphanumeric characters or `-` 3. It must start and end with an alphanumeric character Which can be expressed as the regex: `[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?`, with a maximum length of 63 characters.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] parent: Required. The parent (project and location) where the Memberships will be created. Specified in the format `projects/*/locations/*`.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] request_id: Optional. A request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes after the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
        :param pulumi.Input[pulumi.InputType['MembershipStateArgs']] state: Output only. State of the Membership resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] unique_id: Output only. Google-generated UUID for this resource. This is unique across all Membership resources. If a Membership resource is deleted and another resource with the same name is created, it gets a different unique_id.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] update_time: Output only. When the Membership was last updated.
